# js-sprint-workshop
sprint workshop challenge.

Problem: design a workshop team generator. the generator should accept user input and generate teams, ideally pairing experienced developers with unexperienced developers. execute Analysis, Modeling, Pseudo Coding, Development and Testing to create a solution.

My solution:
* JSON Input for easy addition of an interface later
* Get all users into an array then separate inexperienced and experienced into two more separate arrays. Create teams of two based on the possible conditions that will be present in the two arrays.

How to run:

1. Fill out JSON input file
2. run the program with: ```node app.js```
